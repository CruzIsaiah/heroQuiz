# hero Quiz
Description
Hero Quiz is an interactive personality test built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz presents users with a series of questions and, based on their chosen answers, determines their personality trait as either a hero, villain, edgelord, or civilian. The project also features a unique "ish" feature, appending it to the personality type when the user's score falls below the required threshold of 3 answers for a complete personality type. The background of the website dynamically changes to reflect the resulting personality type, creating an engaging user experience.
